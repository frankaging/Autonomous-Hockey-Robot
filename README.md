More than 140 students showed up on the first day of class this year. Of those, an amazing 113 have completed the journey. Coming from a multitude of backgrounds, these students have gone through a grueling sequence of hands-on projects to develop and hone their skills in each of the critical subdomains of mechatronics, and it all culminates in this five-week project wherein the students formed small groups to design, build, and program teams of fully-autonomous robots to play hockey. While the robots may look similar from a distance, when you get close you recognize that each piece of hardware was custom designed and fabricated, the wires of each circuit were laid out and soldered by hand, and the code running on the embedded MAEVARM M2 processor was written and debugged from scratch. It is truly phenomenal what they have accomplished, so tune in (either in person at the Wu & Chen auditorium, or here via the Livestream) beginning at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, December 11th, when we turn up the music and make our way through this exciting double-elimination tournament!
